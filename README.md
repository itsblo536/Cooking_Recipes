# Cooking Recipes

A final project done after going through a self-guided React and Firebase course. This project utilizes a Firestore database, React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Deployed Website: https://itsblo536.github.io/Cooking_Recipes/

# Description
For this project, I used React to build a website that allows me to create individual recipes, having the option to add ingredients, cooking time, and instructions. I can also view all of the recipes that I have created, as well as search for specific recipes.

# Learning Outcomes
This project helped me learn and become more familiar with React and JavaScript, as these were technologies I hadn't previously learned. I was also able to continue brushing up HTML and CSS skills. Lastly, the project also taught me how to use Firebase and implement a Firestore database to a React project.
